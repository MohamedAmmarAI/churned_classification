# User Churn Prediction App
This is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts whether a user is likely to churn based on their behavioral data.
The application was built using machine learning algorithms, specifically a **Random Forest Classifier**. 
The model was trained using features extracted from user activity data, and the app provides a user-friendly interface for inputting data and viewing predictions.
