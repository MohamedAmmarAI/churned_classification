# User Churn Prediction App
This is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts whether a user is likely to churn based on their behavioral data.
The application was built using machine learning algorithms, specifically a **Random Forest Classifier**. 
The model was trained using features extracted from user activity data, and the app provides a user-friendly interface for inputting data and viewing predictions.

## Features
- **User Input**: The app takes user activity details (like sessions, days after onboarding, total navigations, and more) as input.
- **Prediction**: It outputs a prediction on whether the user will churn or not.
- **Interactive UI**: Built using **Streamlit** for an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **Model**: The app uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on labeled churn data.
